Welcome to a CoreWeave SLURM HPC Cluster

The cluster has the following tooling pre-installed on the login node
- Miniconda: Initialize in your shell with `/opt/conda/bin/conda init bash`
- Micromamba: A fast, lightweight alternative to conda. Initialize in your shell with `micromamba shell init;source .bashrc`.
- Java OpenJDK
- s3cmd and aws cli for interacting with object storage. For large object storage transfers, installing and using rclone in a conda environment is recommended

The login node is intentionally kept with minimal dependencies, allowing users to manage their own environments via conda.
Users can install libraries, tools, different python versions and many other software in venv or conda environments, that will be available on all compute nodes via the home directory.

Compute node images can include other depdendencies, including CUDA, MPI, HPC-X and PyTorch depending on the compute node partition.
Leverage an interactive srun session to test your code in the environment you need. To load default environments, such as CUDA, in a session `module load image-defaults`.

Do not execute compute or I/O intensive tasks directly on the login node. Instead, leverage an interactive shell on a compute node, ie:
- srun -C gpu --gpus=8 --pty bash -i
- srun -C cpu --pty bash -i
