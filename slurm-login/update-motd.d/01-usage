The cluster has the following tooling pre-installed on the login node:
- Anaconda: Initialize in your shell with "/opt/conda/bin/conda init bash"
- Micromamba: A fast, lightweight alternative to conda. Initialize in your shell with "micromamba shell init;source .bashrc".
- Java OpenJDK
- aws cli and s3cmd for interacting with object storage

The login node is intentionally kept with minimal dependencies, allowing users to manage their own environments via conda.
Users can install libraries, tools, different python versions and many other software in venv or conda environments, that will be available on all compute nodes via the home directory.

Compute node images can include other depdendencies, including CUDA, MPI, HPC-X and PyTorch depending on the worker node partition.

Do not execute compute or I/O intensive tasks directly on the login node. Instead, leverage an interactive shell on a compute node, ie:
- srun -C gpu --gpus=8 --pty bash -i
- srun -C cpu --pty bash -i
